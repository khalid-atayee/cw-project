   <p class="some-paragraph-title">CodeWeekend has emerged and evolved to be a web developer accelerator program that
     delivers training and mentoring program to help committed individuals learn how to code and find new or better
     jobs in the market.
     Our goal is to create learning and career-growth opportunities for developers in places of need, to help them
     enhance their programming skills and access a network of opportunities to grow.
     To achieve this goal, we conduct a 4-month long intensive training program with qualified instructors and mentors
     along a market-assessed practical curriculum.
     The pilot phase of this program will be implemented globally. </p>
